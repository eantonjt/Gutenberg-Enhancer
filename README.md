![Gutenberg Enhancer icon](/readme_media/plugin-icon.png "Gutenberg Enhancer icon")

This repo contains the code for the chrome plugin "Gutenberg Enhancer".
This plugin is meant to add this functionality to HTML books on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/):
* Play button to autoplay books similarly to how you can play a video on youtube.
* Easily change display settings for the book, like font-size, background color, margins etc
* Chapter markings to easily go between chapters
* Just provide a more pleasant reading experience in general
A description of the thoughts and solutions that I had when I made this project can be found here LINK.

## Code
This code is written with vanilla Javascript. The project should be refactored to use some framework that makes it easier to handle HTML tags in code, but such a refactoring has not been done at the moment.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute to the project if you feel any feature is missing.
